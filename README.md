# cpu-scheduling-algorithm
Developed a Python program for the various CPU Scheduling Algorithm.
CPU Scheduling Algorithm included:
a. First Come First Serve(FCFS)
b. Shortest Job First(SJF)
c. Shortest Remaining Time First(SRTF)
d. Round Robin(RR)
Along with that I have calculated the completion time for each process, average turn around time, average waiting time, throughput and also printed the Gantt chart.
